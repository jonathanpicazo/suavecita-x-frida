# suavecita-x-frida
### All CSS is located in [App.css](suavecita-x-frida/src/App.css)
To implement this design, I used CSS grid to implement the responsive layout. When the image is smaller than iPad Size (768px), the double columns turn into single columns. The font is not exact, but the result is similar to the design pdf.
